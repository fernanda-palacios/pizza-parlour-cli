Pair Programming (12.5/15):
The report contained some good descriptions of the pair programming process, would be good to include more reflections (what went well and not well in the process).
It would be also nice to also talk about what can be done better next time in terms of pair programming.
It would be nice to be more explicit on which commits were done with pair programming. It is a bit hard to figure out from the commit messages.

Program design (17/20):
The report talked about the various design patterns used in the program (e.g SLAP).
The program design is good in general.

Functionality (20/25):
Have simple input error checking against wrong inputs.
CLI works but the design is a bit inconvenient since the user has to type in commands instead of interact with the cli within one session (while the program is running).

Tests (18/20):
The project achieved very high test coverage (around 97%)). 
Need to start server to run the cli tests though.

Code Craftsmanship (7/10):
There are a few comments included in the codebase. More comments explaining the usage of each function would be better.
The coding style looks clean and consistent.
The report talked about the tools being used for development.

md explanation and organization (8.5/10):
The readme file included good set of instructions on how to run and test the program.
